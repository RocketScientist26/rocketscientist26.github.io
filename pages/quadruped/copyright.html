							<p>The app use <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/package-summary" target="_blank">"Android Speech API"</a> for voice recognition. Privacy policy for it can be found <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
							</br>Crash reports contain device and app related information. Personally identifying information is not required to fix bugs and thus not sought by me or the app. If you have any questions or would like to see a sample crash report, contact me (Giorgi Ivanishvili) at: info@rocket-scientist.me
							</p>
							<p>When changing robot name and/or password, app "Quadruped" stores robot name and password in robot itself for Bluetooth connection (factory default: "Quadruped", "1234"). App also access microphone for voice recognition. Robot name and password are stored in robot and read from app at connection, also they are stored in Android system Bluetooth configurations, but it will not be collected transmitted or stored anywhere else by me in any way.
							</p>
							<h5 class="special">When and for what purpose app use microphone, in details:</h5>
							<p>&nbsp App "Quadruped" access microphone only when "command" button is pressed and held, to detect words and sentences using "Android Speech API" voice recognition service and perform according robot movements. Here is a complete list of detected words and sentences: "stop", "forward", "back", "right", "left", "slide left", "slide right", "swim", "function", "workout", "hello", "faster", "slower", "go", "robot go", "robot stop", "go faster", "slow down". It passes audio to "Android Speech API" voice recognition service only and does not store, record or transmit audio or any detected data anywhere. However "Android Speech API" voice recognition service might use Internet connection itself or collect data..</p>
